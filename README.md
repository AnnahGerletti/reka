This is an app that helps you host a tasting event.

Hosting a tasting event is a great way to bring friends together around a theme while exploring and rating new flavours together. There is always something to talk about when a new _sample_ is just around the corner.

This app helps you organise your guests and what they bring for everyone else to experience. The expectation is the samples are experienced _blind_ so a crowd favourite can emerge by everyone rating their experiences without the influence of brands or any predetermined biases. You can host a tasting for wine, beer, chocolate, or anything you like. It's a ton of fun.


## Documentation
