# tasting.social

This is an app that helps you host a tasting event regardless of what you're _tasting_.

Hosting a tasting event is a great way to bring friends together around a theme and explore new sensations together. There is always something to talk about when a new _sample_ is just around the corner.

This app helps you organise your guests and their offerings. The expectation is the samples are _blind_ so a crowd favourite can emerge without the influence of brand or any predetermined biases. You can host a tasting for wine, beer, chocolate, or anything you like. It's a ton of fun for everyone.
